        <h3 id="intro-to-Node">What is Node</h3>
        <p>
            Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8
            engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. Source: Wikipedia
        </p>
        <p>Before in time JavaScript was only frontend code that could run in browsers.
            With V8 runtime JavaScript became independent of browsers.
            Now we can create scripts, and invoke them. Software and backends.
            Node is a runtime that wraps the scripts built on V8.
            Node in cli calls the REPL to run a file or a statement -read, evaluate, print, loop.
            All languages have REPLs, Python also has it, with highlighting and autocompletion.

                Node is a platform that fills a particular need and understanding this is absolutely essential. You
                definitely don’t want to use Node.js for CPU-intensive operations; in fact, using it for heavy
                computation will annul nearly all of its advantages. Where Node really shines is in building fast,
                scalable network applications, as it’s capable of handling a huge number of simultaneous connections
                with high throughput, which equates to high scalability. <br>Source:

        <h3 id="js-datatypes">JavaScript datatypes</h3>
        <p>
            JavaScript is a loosely typed -it doesn't convert the type until runtime- and a dynamic language 
            -any variable can be assigned values of all types. The rimitive values are innmutable, String, 
            Boolean, BigInt, number, null, undefined and objects which are collections of properties are mutable like arrays.
        </p>
        <p> <b>Mental Note:</b> Always use hard equality check- ‘2 === 2’, it shows I understand the datatypes I'm using
            AND don't concatenate different datatypes.

        <h3 id="js-variables">JavaScript variables</h3>
        <p>Javascript <b>variable identifiers: var, let, const or nothing.</b>
            We should always declare JavaScript variables with var,let, or const. The var keyword is used in all
            JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015. The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015. Only if you
            want your code to run in an older browser, you must use var, as it has a global scope and so it’s not
            recommended.
            When to Use JavaScript const??? As a general rule you should <b>always declare variables with const unless
                you think the value of the variable will change, then we should use let.</b>
        </p>
