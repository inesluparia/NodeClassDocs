        <p>Clean code and following code conventions is a key to readability. The key is to be consistent throughout the
            project.

        <h3 id="npm-package.json">Npm and package.json</h3>
        <p>The package.json file fullfills three responsibilities. It has the functional attributes of a project that
            npm uses to
            install dependencies, run scripts, and identify the entry point to our package. It also records metadata
            about a project which is required before publishing to NPM.
        </p>
        <p>
            To import code defined in another file also called modules it needs to be imported with the keyword
            <b>'require'</b>
            The result of require is then stored in a variable which is used to invoke the functions using the dot
            notation.

        <h3 id="body-parsing">Body parsing</h3>
        <p>To handle HTTP POST requests in Express.js you used to need to install the module called body-parser.
            Which extracts the entire body portion of an incoming request stream and exposes it on req.body.
            This body-parser module parses the JSON data submitted using HTTP POST request.
            After Express 4.16, to parse JSON bodies we can just use:

                JavaScript Hoisting refers to the process whereby the interpreter appears to move the declaration of
                functions,
                variables or classes to the top of their scope, prior to execution of the code. Hoisting allows
                functions to be
                safely used in code before they are declared.
