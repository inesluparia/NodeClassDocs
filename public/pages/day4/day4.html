            <i>To serve static files such as images, CSS files, and JavaScript files, use the express.static
                built-in middleware function in Express. The function signature is: express.static(root, [options]).
                <br>
                The root argument specifies the root directory from which to serve static assets. In node by convention,
                static files
                are served in the public folder.<br>Source: <a

        <p>
            In opposition to a client-side or single page application, server side rendering sends the fully
            rendered page to the client. So SSR loads whole new pages from the server, which can result in performance
            issues and a less dynamic experience but on the other hand, it can also be helpful in situations when then
            rendering of the whole page on client-side takes too much time. Another significant tradeoff advantage
            is that it doesn't affect SEO negatively like CSR does. They are usually easier to maintain and implement
            the navigation.

            In express we implemented SSR by rendering a template conformed by different html components before
            sending it to the client as a response.
