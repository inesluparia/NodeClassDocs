        <p>Immutability and a functional approach to loops are preferred as FOR loops are error prone,
            overly verbose and not functional. There's also no big difference in performance. Functional
            iterations don't modify the object.

        <p><i>Nodemon is CLI utility that wraps your Node app, watches the file system, and <b>automatically
            restarts the process after every change.</b> Source:

        </p>
        <p>It is a good idea to install it globaly as its avoids having to run the script after every change.
            Just executing command nodemon + app.js or index. js will run your project. You can also specify it in a
            script for the development environment.
        </p>
        <p>It supports a configuration file -nodemon.json- where you can specify which file extentions to monitor for
            changes.
